This folder contains specific data for the Source Parts parts. For now,
I am including the eeprom data I flashed to my Stovetop add-on board
which matches the overlay which is provided in the devicetrees folder.
Please note that this eeprom isn't "blessed" by Source Parts yet and is
unlikely to be the final version, but it is useful for testing the
Stovetop prototype.

Included is also my devicetree for the Original Popcorn. It's still a
work-in-progress.
